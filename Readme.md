### Suvam's Drag-and-Drop Website

### Description

This project demonstrates a simple drag-and-drop interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to move list items between two boxes, with support for:

Drag-and-drop functionality between two containers (left and right).
Persistent state using localStorage so the list items remain in their last position even after a page refresh.
Keyboard navigation support for accessibility, allowing users to move items between boxes using keyboard commands.

### Features
Drag-and-Drop: Users can drag items from the left box to the right box and vice versa. The dragged item has visual feedback (reduced opacity) while being moved.
Persistent Storage: The state of the boxes is saved to the browser's localStorage, so the arrangement of items is remembered across page reloads.
Accessibility Support: Users can move items between boxes using keyboard navigation (by pressing Enter or Space).
Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be flexible and looks good on all screen sizes.


### How to Use
* Drag-and-Drop Items:

Drag any item from the left box to the right box or vice versa.
The dragged item will have reduced opacity, giving feedback while moving.
When dropped into a new box, the state is automatically saved.
Keyboard Navigation:

You can also move items using your keyboard:
Use Tab to focus on a list item.
Press Enter or Space to move the focused item between the boxes.
You can focus on the boxes as well (Tab to focus on the left/right box).
Persistent Storage:

When you move items between the boxes, their positions are saved to localStorage.
Refreshing the page will not reset the position; the items will remain in the same box as when you last left them.
